Data from the New Zealand government shows number of deaths are increasing.

Data source: https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/births-and-deaths-year-ended-september-2023/

This python script plots the data - similar to what you can do in Excel.

Thanks to ChatGPT for generating the code via number of prompts by myself.
